FLOW CHART

1. User input => 2. Multiply each digit by a pattern of 2 1 2 1 2 1.. =>
3. sum up the digits (14 becomes 1 + 4) => 4. subtract last digit with 10 =>
5. Check if answer is the same as control digit

2. Multiply
multiply each position in array EXCEPT last position with a for loop?
the number to be multiplied with can be found if i variable is even or odd
if even multiply with 2, odd with 1.
save in a new array

control if you can get the sums in a new array

3. Addition
